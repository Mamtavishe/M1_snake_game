## SNAKE GAME

The c programming language was used to create this Miniproject. Snake Game is a no-frills console game. We can play the popular "Snake Game" in this project in the same way we do in other places. To move the snake, we must utilise the right, left, up, and down arrows.

The snake can devour the foods that are placed at various co-ordinates on the screen. The length of the snake, as well as the score, will grow by one element each time it consumes the food.

This C Snake game mini project allows users to play the game with three lives. As the snake meets a wall or its own body, its life count diminishes. You can even pause the game in the middle of the game with any key in this small project.

## Introduction
The game called "Snake" or "Snake Game" typically involve the player controlling a line or snake, there is no official version of the game, so gameplay varies. The most common version of the game involves the snake or line eating items which make it longer, with the objective being to avoid running into a border or the snake itself for as long as possible.

The player loses when the snake either runs into a border or its own body. Because of this, the game becomes more difficult as it goes on, due to the growth of the snake.Nokia has installed the "Snake Game" on many of its phones. The game is also available on several websites, including YouTube, which allows viewers to play the game while a video loads.

## Features

*This snake game is just similar to games which are found under mobile games section. It uses the concept of graphics to display the menu items and all objects on a single screen.

*An instruction has been given on the top right side of the menu where users must go through the instruction to play this game.

*Players will able to check their result after games get over.

*The score section will display the total score of the player, game level maze which has been used.

*The object snake position has been set random, so whenever player will Start the game, the snake will appear at random location every time.

*The snake object will always appear in WHITE color. The ARROW keys "UP,DOWN,RIGHT,LEFT" has been set within the program to move the snake to right, left, top and bottom respectively


## FEATURE SCOPE

Our project will be able to implement in future making some changes and modifications as we make my project at a very low level. So the modifications that can be done in my project are:

after

1.It can be made with good graphics.

We can add more options like Top scores and Player Profile

We can add multiplayer option

## CONCLISION

This Project in C language of Snake Game is a simple console application with very simple graphics. In this project, you can play the popular "Snake Game" just like you played it elsewhere. You have to use the up, down, right or left arrows to move the snake.

Foods are provided at the several co-ordinates of the screen for the snake to eat. Every time the snake eats the food, its length will by increased by one element along with the score. It isn't the world's greatest game, but it does give you an idea of what you can achieve with a relatively simple C program, and perhaps the basis by which to extend the principles and create more interesting games of your own.
